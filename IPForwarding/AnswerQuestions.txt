Algorithm CountLeavesPreOrder(node, currentDistance)
  if node is null then
    return 0
  end if

  if currentDistance is 9 and node has no children then
    return 1
  end if

  leafCount := 0
  for each child in node.children do
    leafCount := leafCount + CountLeavesPreOrder(child, currentDistance + 1)
  end for

  return leafCount
End Algorithm

// Usage:
root := initialize your tree here
leafCount := CountLeavesPreOrder(root, 0) // Start with distance 0 from the root
Print "Number of leaves at distance 9: ", leafCount
